## Import Sources

The import_sources directory (/db/import_sources) is used to configure urls to be used for importing data for properties into PropertyWebBuilder.

All .yml files in the import_sources directory will be picked up by the "pwb:import_from_urls" rake task and used to import properties into the current website.
